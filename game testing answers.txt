-changing weapons works pretty well
-player movement could be a tiny bit faster
-i didnt see the enemy attack
-the level was fine
-hitting the nemies was hard with most weapons
-the game was easy because you cant die but hitting enemies was hard
-sometimes walking onto the path would send the player into the air though it is a very small amount
	
	

Sort of- the hitting doesnt feel correct but it does work, i like the theme but a better controls could be apprecriated 
the weapon variety and fliudidy are execelent except you should swap to that weapon not go to fists, the enemies werent working from what i saw
but the level look promising
not really any hard parts per say but there could b!!
some tips
a more detailed level with working and impactful enemies would make it a really good experience.
